1. OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Console  Plugin creates  a console  window where  user can  run other   plugins'
services, see what they return, check and set variables and operate on flags.
It can be a very helpful tool during plugin development. It can also be 
considered as a mini powerpro Shell console. It can also be very helpful for 
script creation / debug.


The plugin has been tested with PowerPro versions: 3.8 and higher. 
Version 1.04 is for powerpro above version 5.03

3. INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to  use the  plugin, you  should place  it in  your PowerPro  'plugins'
directory.  If you do not have  'plugins'  directory,  you  probably  have older
version of PowerPro.  In this case place the plugin  directly  in your  PowerPro
directory. After that you can use its services just like services from any other
plugin. Read PowerPro's help for general information on using plugins.

4. SERVICES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
show ("path_to_ini_file")
        Creates a console window. Only one  console window can exist  at a  time
        and thus, when a  console window  is shown,  consecutive calls to show()
        service  are ignored.
        Argument  "path_to_ini_file"  specifies  text file   with  settings  for
        the plugin.   This argument  can be  omitted and  then the  plugin  uses
        its  hardcoded   defaults.   See   below   for   more   information   on
        the configuration file.

minimize minimize console window.

swing("path_to_ini_file")
        if console is created:
		    minimize console if visible
			restore console if minimized
        if console is not created:
		    create and show console like using show() service


close ()
        Closes the console window. This operation deletes all information in the
        console window, which means that next call to show() service will create
        a completely  new console  window: empty,  with no  watches set, with no
        information on previously used commands.

restart ()
        Closes the console window and recreate a new one.

execute ("command")
        Executes "command" on the console.  Console  window will be opened if it
        is closed.  All double quote characters in  "command"  must  be preceded
        by an escape character, e.g.
        console.execute("win.handle('"PowerPro*'")")

print ("command")
        Prints "command" on the console replacing current command line.  Console
        will be  opened if  it is  closed.   All  double  quote    characters in
        "command"     must    be    preceded    by     an    escape   character,
        e.g. console.print("win.handle('"PowerPro*'")")
        
append ("command")
        Prints  "command" on  the console appending it to the end of the current
        command line. Console window will be opened if it is closed.  All double
        quote characters in "command"  must be preceded  by an escape  character,
        e.g. console.append("win.handle('"PowerPro*'")")

history()
        Returns a string whith the history all command are separated by \n.
        
handle()
        Returns the current console handle.
        
inifile()
        Return a string with the current ini file.

        
version()
        Return a string with the current plugin version.

Services that  do not  take any  arguments,  can  also be used without brackets.

5. CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuration file let you customize the  look of the console window. Its syntax
is similar to that of regular INI files. Every line starting with a semicolon is
treated as a comment. Section names must be put in square brackets. 

In the current version the file can have these sections and settings:
FontSettings - section
   Name  - name of the font, it  must be put in double quotes
   Size  - size of the font
   Bold  - 1 - bold font, 0 - normal font

   # dedicated font for the watches window
   WName - name of the font, it  must be put in double quotes
   WSize - size of the font
   WBold - 1 - bold font, 0 - normal font

   
Appearance - section
   Prompt - string used as prompt, it must be put in double quotes
   CopyrightNote - controls showing copyright note, 0 - do not show, 1 - show
   Height - height of console window
   Width - width of console window
   Resizable - controls whether the window is resizable, 0 - not , 1 - resizable
   Left - initial vertical position of the window
   Top - initial horizontal position of the window
   
   RememberPos - Write back position and size of window
   Transparency - set transparency (-1 no transparency, 0 = opaque 255 invisible
   PopupWindow -  1 : for small titlebar and small button / 0 : Regular window

History - section (This section is automatically rewritten at each execution !)
   next - position to use for writing next command 0..29
   H00 to H30 history line

For every setting  which is not  present in the  configuration file, the  plugin
uses its  hardcoded default  value. Hence there  is  no  need to include  every
setting in the ini file.

Default setting for show without ini parameter is taken from ?'\(pprofolder)\plugins\console.ini

Appearance.PProProcessName and History.PProProcessName are dedicated sections for each 
secondary process.
( Position and history will be saved using proces name as a KEY.)

6. PLUGIN USAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the console is shown, the following commands can be used:

exit
        Closes console window. Works like close() service. 
debug
       Call setDebug( string) and print debug status        

set
        Sets the value of the variable.
        Syntax:
               set variablename value

        'value' argument can be omitted and then the variable is cleared.
        Names of variables cannot be longer than 63 characters.

get
        Returns the value of the variable.
        Syntax:
               get variablename

        Names of variables cannot be longer than 63 characters.
        'Get' cannot be used to check values of PowerPro keywords.

flag
        Performs operations on flags.
        Syntax:
               flag set n1 n2
               flag clear n1 n2
               flag reverse n1 n2
        This commands will set or clear or toggle flags of numbers from n1 to n2.
        'n2' argument can be omitted.

watch1, ..., watch5
        Sets watches at positions from 1 to 5.
        Syntax:
               watch1 variablename

        This command sets watch 1 to 'variablename'.
        Names of variables cannot be longer than 63 characters.

        Watches for PowerPro keywords are not supported.

won
        Turnes watches on.
        Syntax:
               won interval

        'interval' argument specifies the  interval in seconds between  checking
        variables on the watch list. If  it  is  omitted then  the deafult value
        of 3 seconds is used.
        Below the list of watches,  there  is a list of all PowerPro flags shown
        with this format: flagnumber(state)

woff
        Turnes watches off.

help
        Show a minimal help.

history
        Show history of command.

F1 KEY  
        Show Powerpro Help with alphabetical list of function.

F2 KEY
        ShowFilmenu pprofolder\pprofunction.twt

F3 KEY  
        Show Powerpro pickString with console history inside.

F12 KEY  
        Open the current ini file.
        
[ctrl]+F12 KEY  
        Restarts the console

!       used as a prefix replace do("Cmd", parameters)
  
        
All other commands are send to PowerPro for evaluation.
Through evaluation you can do the following:

- run services from other plugins and get their return values:
        plugin.service(arguments...)

- get values of PowerPro keywords:
        e.g. pprofolder, pproversion, date, time and so on.

- get status of PowerPro flags:
        pproflag(flag number)

- get values of regular PowerPro variables, it then works like 'get' command.


Up and down arrows can be used to cycle through the list of previous commands.

USING CONSOLE  PLUGIN SERVICES  FROM WITHIN  A CONSOLE  WINDOW IS NOT SUPPORTED.
Commands which would  invoke Console Plugin  services are not  processed by  the
plugin. However, you can still rename  Console.dll  to some other name and  then
try to use this  new one's services from  within its console window.   DO NOT DO
THIS!  It may crash PowerPro!
